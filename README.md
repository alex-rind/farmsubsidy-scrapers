FarmSubsidy.org Scrapers
========================

[FarmSubsidy](http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/) is a website that collects the payment data of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) which represents about a third of the EU budget. It was run by a group of journalists and activists for the past years. In 2013 the [OpenSpending project](http://openspending.org/) of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) took over responsibility of the website.

The FarmSubsidy data is mostly scraped from member state websites. The old scrapers were working well, but were running in costly and proprietary software. This year we need Free and Open Source scrapers and this repository will collect these scrapers and coordinate the effort.

Please have a look at the [member state scraper issues](https://github.com/openspending/farmsubsidy-scrapers/issues?labels=memberstate&page=1&state=open). If you can help provide a scraper that would be awesome.


Data Format
-----------

General exchange format will be CSV. [Past data is available at data.farmsubsidy.org](http://data.farmsubsidy.org/).

Requirements for scrapers are not yet determined. A likely format is just a unix program that outputs scraped CSV.
