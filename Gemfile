#Gemfile for farmsubsidy scrapers in Ruby

#If you have requirements for your scrapers, process like this:
#1) Look here, if the requirement is already listet here
#2)   If requirement is listed:
#2.1) Try to run your code with the listed version number,so that we run into as few 
#     versioning conflicts as possible
#2.2) Add the country code of your scraper on top of the requirement, eventually together with 
#     an additional note
#3)   If requirement is not listed:
#     Add requirement together with version number (!) and country code
