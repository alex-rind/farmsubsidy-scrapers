Writing a scraper is painful (ASP viewstate).

Manually downloading CSV files from search by "Alap" and "Forr√°s" works though.
The individual files are stored in `data/` with the format `$ALAP-$FORRAS-$YEAR.csv`.
The provided Jupyter notebook combines these files and exports them into the necessary CSV.
